# Williamson County Business Scraper

## Changes Made

This repository has been modified to focus specifically on businesses in Williamson County, TX instead of scraping businesses from all 50 states.

### Key Modifications:

1. **State Filtering**: Modified `bizbuysell_fetch.py` to only scrape Texas businesses (19 categories vs 950 previously)
   - Reduced from all 50 states to just Texas
   - This significantly reduces API calls and processing time

2. **Williamson County Filtering**: Added `filter_williamson_county_listings()` function
   - Filters Texas businesses to only include those in Williamson County
   - Includes major cities: Austin, Cedar Park, Georgetown, Round Rock, Leander, Pflugerville, Hutto, Taylor, Liberty Hill, Jarrell, Florence, Weir, Granger, Bartlett, Coupland, Thrall
   - Checks for "Williamson County" or "Williamson Co" in address text
   - Checks for any of the major Williamson County cities

3. **Updated Output**: Modified `bizbuysell_updates.py` to:
   - Import the new filtering function
   - Apply Williamson County filtering after parsing listings
   - Save results to `williamson_county_listings.csv`
   - Provide specific feedback about Williamson County listings found

### Usage:

```bash
# Run the focused scraper
